Money laundering detection is a global challenge
and it has always been a billion dollar issue. The
primary objective involved researching the utilization of machine learning systems to tackle this
issue. Employing machine learning algorithms,
we specifically concentrated on synthetic data
for model training, and conducted a comparative
study utilizing Graph Neural Networks (GNN),
Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting methodologies.
